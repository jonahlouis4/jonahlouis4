Greetings, I'm Jonah --- a full-stack web developer volunteering for [Isha Foundation](https://isha.sadhguru.org/ca/en) and [iContribute](https://icontribute.community/#/). In the past few years, I've been expanding my skills in a way I have never done before, having worked on an extendable amount of projects. I'm looking forward to seeing what else the world has to offer to me and to the upcoming adventures it will bring!
